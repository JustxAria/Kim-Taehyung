             Pre-debut, he was the "secret member" of BTS.
             Fans were unaware of his existence as his agency wished to keep him a surprise.
            He stated the concept had made him feel uneasy and lonely as he thought it was because he might get cut from the lineup.
            [13] On June 13, 2013, he made his debut as a member of BTS on Mnet's M Countdown with the track "No More Dream" from their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool.
